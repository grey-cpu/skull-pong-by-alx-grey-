# Skull Pong by Alex Grey

## Overview
Skull Pong is a classic Pong-style game with a fun twist — the ball is a pixel-style skull that changes color every time it hits a paddle or wall. The game speeds up every 10 successful paddle hits, making the challenge grow progressively harder.

- Controls:  
  - Left paddle: W (up), S (down)  
  - Right paddle: Up arrow (up), Down arrow (down)  
- Skull ball changes to a random bright color on every collision
